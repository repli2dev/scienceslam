# How to work with Nette Science slam web

* Most pages are located at app/templates/
* After a page change, cache file for that page needs to be cleaned -- delete temp/cache/latte
  - If you cannot delete the file, move the whole latte folder (latte -> latte.x)

## Deployment

Dropping cache is needed after deployment where there are changes in templates or config(s).
Due to permission problems manual intervention from will be needed:
Access: https://scienceslam.muni.cz/drop-cache.php?key=<key>
Key is accessible in `app/config/config.local.neon` in key `maintenance.key`
